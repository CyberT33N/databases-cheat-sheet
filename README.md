AlloyDB AI's ScaNN Index Boosts Vector and Hybrid Search Performance (5 minute read)

AlloyDB AI now integrates Google Research's ScaNN index to accelerate vector similarity searches by up to 3x and enable hybrid queries combining keyword and embedding-based retrieval. By supporting both dense and sparse data types, as well as custom distance metrics, ScaNN delivers sub-millisecond lookup times at scale. This enhancement sharpens relevance and recall across use cases while preserving AlloyDB's managed, serverless simplicity and strong consistency guarantees.
